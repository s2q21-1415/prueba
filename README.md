#Laravel (4.2)

##Using the Pack
To use the Pack, we created 2 menu options, which you can find on the right of the menu. These menus can be configured in the `.codio` file.

1. **PHP Version** : This will show you the version of PHP installed.
1. **Preview** : This previews your app.

**Note:** Do not set the 'Inside Codio' option as this Laravel scaffold does 
not allow it to run in an IFrame and incorrect behaviour may also result.

##Accessing the application
To access your application from a browser, you can use the menu option described above. The url of your Laravel project can be found in the `Project->Box Info` menu and will look something like this

```
https://vital-ego.box.codio.io:9500/
```
##How the Pack was prepared
This Starter Pack was built on the `LAMP + Composer` Codio Certified Stack.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
